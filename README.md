# Unified-RI-FDTD
###This project is a demonstration of a new unified 3D CEM simulation method for dispersive media like Debye, Lorentz, and Drude. In this Matlab code, dispersive media and PML truncated boundaries are described in a uniform manner based on an efficient recursive integral method. The stability of this method can be fully validated by the von Neuman method combied with the Routh-Hurwitz cirterion.
